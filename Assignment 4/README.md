Normalization eliminates data redundancy and enhances data integrity in the table. Normalization also helps to organize the data in the database. It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.
 
Normalization organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly execute their dependencies. It is a systematic technique of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion anomalies.
 

1st Normal Form (1NF)
A table is referred to as being in its First Normal Form if the atomicity of the table is 1.
Here, atomicity states that a single cell cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only a single-valued attribute.
The First normal form disallows the multi-valued attribute, composite attribute, and their combinations.
 
 
 
 
 
In our table we had multiple values in the column Skills,we modified according to the 1NF form
 
 

 
 
Second Normal Form (2NF)
The first condition for the table to be in Second Normal Form is that the table has to be in First Normal Form.
The table should not possess partial dependency. The partial dependency here means the proper subset of the candidate key should give a non-prime attribute.


Third Normal Form (3NF)
The first condition for the table to be in the Third Normal Form is that the table should be in the Second Normal Form.
The second condition is that there should be no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes, which indicates that non-prime attributes (not a part of the candidate key) should not depend on other non-prime attributes in a table. Therefore, a transitive dependency is a functional dependency in which A → C (A determines C) indirectly, because of A → B and B → C (where it is not the case that B → A).
The Third Normal Form ensures the reduction of data duplication. It is also used to achieve data integrity.
